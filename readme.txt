== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip mp2wp.zip.
1. Upload the folder containing `mp2wp.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. To add a Metaplace world on a sidebar, browse to Design > Widgets and add the 'mp2wp widget" to desired sidebar. Configure the world title, embedding dimensions and world name and save your changes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the minimum size for embedding a Metaplace world? =

Minimum size should be 400 pixels in height and widht. Otherwise people cannot login, because the "Enter this world" line is not shown in the frame. 

= I don't see any border around my embedded world =

Borders have been deliberately turned off in the plugin. If you want to get rid of this you may edit the `mp2wp.php` and remove all occurances of the HTML code `frameborder="0"`.

= How do I add a virtual world to a blog-post? =

To add a virtual world to any post or page just add the markup `[mp2wp]worldname,width,height[/mp2wp]`, for instance `[mp2wp]ComicEmporium,500,450[/mp2wp]`. Note that supplying the worldname is mandatory while the width and height parameters are optional. Which means that you may specify only the worldname or only the worldname & width. Therefore, `[mp2wp]ComicEmporium,500[/mp2wp]` and `[mp2wp]ComicEmporium[/mp2wp]` are valid tags. Also note that the order of width & height is important and worldname, width and height must be separated with commas. Lastly, the closing tag `[/mp2wp]` is mandatory.

= Can I add multiple embedded worlds on a post or page? =

Yes you can. Just add multiple `[mp2wp]` tags where required. All of these can be configured independently.

= Can I add multiple mp2wp widgets on the sidebar? =

Unfortunately no. As of now you can only add one instance on the sidebar.

== Screenshots ==
